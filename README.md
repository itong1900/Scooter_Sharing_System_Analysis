# Scooter_Sharing_System_Analysis

This also a final project of UC Berkeley course Data102 Fall-2019.

## Setup
You've been tasked with analyzing the public datasets released by three bike sharing com- 
panies in New York, Washington DC, and Chicago. Another data scientist has helpfully
preprocessed the dataset for you in four files that can be found here: https://github.com/ds-102/fa19/tree/master/project/bikeshare.zip.
The ny.csv, chicago.csv, and dc.csv each contain the bike rentals that occurred in 2016
in their respective cities with each row representing a single rental.
The day.csv dataset contains daily bike rental information between the years 2011 and
2012 in Washington DC. The original bike rental dataset has also been merged with weather
information and holiday information using other data sources.
If you're curious you can find the original datasets at the following links

## Sections
The whole analysis project is divided into two sections, parsing the scooter's usage data from diversed perspectives in different methods.

### Section I will include the following:
1. Preliminary Data Analysis
2. Hypothesis Testing
3. Gaussian Mixture Models of Trip Durations
4. Causality and Experiment Design

### Section II will include the following:
1. Reinforcement Learning with Multi-Armed Bandits Method
2. Data Privacy Discussion
